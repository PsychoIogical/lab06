Bug list:
Summary: This is not a queue, but a stack.
-A queue works as a First In, First Out (FIFO) data structure. As we can see
in test 13, we queue 1, 2, then 3, but we are returns 3, 2, then 1. This is
similar to a stack data structure, which operates with a Last In, First Out
(LIFO) system. We can also see from Tests 3 and 8 that order is not kept.

-peekFront() is working correctly, but front and back pointers are swapped.
